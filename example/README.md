# Gatsby Theme - Auth0

TODOS:

- [ ] Update this readme
- [ ] Update .env.example and warning to include callback url
- [ ] Fix types
- [ ] Add tests

A usage of
[gatsby-theme-auth0](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-auth0)
that does nothing but use the theme. As a result you will see `Error: Missing resources for /` when navigating to `localhost:8000`. To get
rid of that, create a page in `src/pages/index.js`.
